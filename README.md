🚀 Overview
This project is the frontend foundation for a smart recommendation platform powered by AI. Built using React + TypeScript + Vite, it is optimized for performance, scalability, and clean component-based development. It serves as a UI base where AI-based recommendation models can be integrated to deliver personalized suggestions to users — such as products, content, or features — based on user behavior or preferences.

The project is styled with TailwindCSS for a modern, responsive design and is deployed seamlessly using Vercel + GitHub CI/CD.
